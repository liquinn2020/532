        <div class="text-content">
            <p>I am a first-year graduate student at Indiana University with an undergraduate degree in Informatics and a minor in Human-Centered Computing. I haven't decided what I want to do career-wise yet, but I know that wherever I go, it will be a great option for me. I come from a background where my dad is a lawyer and my mom is a speech pathologist. My family has diverse interests, including my brother with a finance background and my sister with a biology background, which is unique.</p>

            <p>One of my favorite hobbies is baseball. I enjoy going to Chicago Cubs games. I've been attending since the age of five and I'm a die-hard fan! I love going to games with my family and friendsâ€”nothing beats a ball game on a summer night!</p>

            <p>One of my interests includes working with Accessibility. I have been involved with the ServeIT Non-Profit Clinic in Bloomington. From 2023-2024, I worked as a student intern, and since starting graduate school, I have been working as a graduate advisor. I enjoy working with the city of Bloomington to improve website accessibility for non-profits, and this project has been a huge success!</p>
