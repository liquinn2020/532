<h1>More Infomation about Myself</h1>
<p>I am a first yaer graduate studnet here at Indiana Unversity with an underdraguate degree in Infomatics and a minor in Human-Centered-Computing.  I haven't decided what I want to do careerwise yet, but I know whereever I go would be a great option for me.  I come from a background where my Dad is a lawyer and Mom is a speech pathlogist.  All of my family has different intrests including my brother with a finnace background and sister with a biology background, which is unique</p> <br>
<p>One of my favorite hobbies is baseball.  I enjoy going to Chicago Cubs games.  I've been going since the age of five and I'm a die hard fan! I enjoy going to games with my family and friends, nothing wrong with a ball game on a summer night!</p> <br>

From 2023-2024 I worked as a studnet intern and from the start of the Graduate School I have been working as a graduate advisor.  I enjoy working with the city of Bloomington in conducting website accessbility non-profits better and this project has been a huge success!  </p>
